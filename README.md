# AutoVault
AutoVault is a secure, cloud-ready file storage web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their files safely. Only authenticated users can upload, view, download, and delete their files, ensuring complete data privacy and access control.  Each uploaded file in AutoVault is assigned an expiry time defined by the user. The system uses automation to send email notifications before file expiry and automatically delete expired files, eliminating the need for manual cleanup and reducing storage misuse.  AutoVault is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, and is designed to be locally functional first, with a clear path to migrate storage, automation, and notifications to cloud services such as AWS.
